# Retrieving OpenStreetMap data in Python

If you want to retrieve Geospatial data from OpenStreetMap (OSM), you can simply download it, but that takes time and storage. Without leaving your development environment (Jupyter Notebooks), you can access and retrieve OpenStreetMap data. Imagine you are doing analysis and want to find out how many recreational facility or restaurants are in your interested area. 

In this tutorial, we learn to retrieve OpenStreetMap data using OSMNX, a python package. 
OSMnx is a Python package that lets you download spatial geometries and model, project, visualize, and analyze street networks and other spatial data from OpenStreetMap's API


In the next three sections, we retrieve three different kinds of data from OpenStreetMap: Cafes as points of interest, buildings, and street networks. We also explore Geospatial data visualization with Folium.
